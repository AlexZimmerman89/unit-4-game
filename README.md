# Indiana-Jones-RPG-Game
Fight the Mola Ram
This repository was created for UNCC's Coding Bootcamp homework assignment #4 with a goal of creating a fun and interactive web-based game. This time, the app must dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery library.

Getting Started
Instructions: There are four characters displayed and each character has a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
Mola Ram will reveal a random number at the start of the game between 19 - 120. When you click on a character, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score. To win, you will need to match the character score to Mola Ram's random number. You lose if your
												score goes above Mola Ram's
												random number. The game will restart once
												you win or lose.

Built With
HTML5 CSS3 Twitter-Bootstrap - Framework JavaScript jQuery - JavaScript Library

The player will have to guess the answer, just like in the Psychic Game. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters.
