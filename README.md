<strong>Fight the Mola Ram</strong>

<strong>Getting Started</strong><br>
Instructions: There are four characters displayed and each character has a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
Mola Ram will reveal a random number at the start of the game between 19 - 120. When you click on a character, it will add a specific amount of points to your total score. To win, you will need to match the character score to Mola Ram's random number. You lose if your
												score goes above Mola Ram's
												random number. The game will restart once
												you win or lose.

The player will have to guess the answer, just like in the Predictions Game. This time, though, the player will guess with numbers instead of letters.
